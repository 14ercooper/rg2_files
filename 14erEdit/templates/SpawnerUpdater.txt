This file can be used as a base to create a 14erEdit brush that replaces all of 1 type of spawner with another.
For example, if you have several zombie spawners and want to change them all to creeper spawners, this will do that.

There are two methods to do this, both following a similar 3 step process.
The first is easier and works if you still know the data of the old spawner.
The second requires you to get the coordinates of one of the old spawners and use it as a "reference" to compare to.

Step 1:
Option A:
execute if block ~ ~ ~ <spawner_to_replace> run setblock ~ ~ ~ <new_spawner>
Take this command and replace both <spawner_to_replace> and <new_spawner> with the spawner data from a mcstacker setblock minecraft:spawner command, that is: spawner{SpawnData:{...}}

OR

Option B:
execute if blocks ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <coords_of_reference_spawner> masked run setblock ~ ~ ~ <new_spawner>

Replace <new_spawner> with the spawner data from a mcstacker setblock minecraft:spawner command, that is: spawner{SpawnData:{...}}
Then input the coordinates of the “reference spawner” you using instead of the <coords_of_reference_spawner> 


Step 2:
Save that line with the new spawner data in a .txt file named OldtoNew.txt
Name the text file OldToNew.txt and move it into the 14erEdit/templates folder.


Step 3:
Boot up the MMS, then use this brush:
/fx br s 10 0.5 if spawner template OldToNew.txt 0


Then you're done! Your brush will replace only the specific type of spawner you want it to!


To summarise what each step is doing for clarity:
Step 1 - create an execute command that checks if the spawner is the one you’re looking for
Step 2 - save that command inside a .txt file
Step 3 - put that file in the right folder
Step 4 - make a brush that targets spawners


P.S. if you're using option 2 be careful not to overwrite your reference spawner.
P.P.S. if you're using lots of different variants of the same mob in a small space, it may be safer to use Option 2.
